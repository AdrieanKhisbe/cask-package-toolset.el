* Cask Package Toolset

In building project to help you start or tool up your emacs package project.

** Installation

Just add this has dependency to your =Cask= file

: (depends-on "cask-package-toolset")

** Usage
+ View usage information:

  : $ cask exec package-toolset help
+ Say hello
  : $ cask cask exec package-toolset yo

** Notes

This is still a prototype. So if ever you think about using it, prefer the =master= branch, and expect to update your config.

If POC is working, happen to be usefull, (/will personnaly use it to "toolsettize" personnage package I built but not yet made public)
I will see with the =Cask= team to incorporate it to make it helpful to the comunity, and help promote use of integration and tests.

*If you have any remark, refactor suggestion or else, just pose an issue ;)*
