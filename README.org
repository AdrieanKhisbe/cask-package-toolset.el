/Continuous Integration for EmacsLisp without pain!/

** About

The goal of *Cask Package Toolset* is to promote the use of integration and tests to
have even better emacs library, where it's more easy to contribute and build new features! :)
All that without fearing regressions, and unwanted breaking changes.

It does that by *helping you to start or tool up your emacs package project* with
best continuous integration practices and emacs tools.
Among which [[travis-ci.org][travis]], [[https://github.com/rejeep/evm][evm]], [[https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el][ert-runner]], [[https://github.com/ecukes/ecukes][ecukes]], [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]], [[https://github.com/sviridov/undercover.el][undercover]], [[https://coveralls.io/][coveralls]].

This is inspired from the [[http://rejeep.github.io/emacs/cask/ert/ert-runner/ert-async/ecukes/testing/travis/2014/01/09/various-testing-tools-in-emacs.html][following blog post]] of [[https://github.com/rejeep/][@Rejeep]] who had brought to us [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]],
[[https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el][Ert-runner]] and [[https://github.com/rejeep/evm][Emacs Version Management]] (and many more :)).

** Installation

Just add this has dependency to your =Cask= file

: (depends-on "cask-package-toolset")

** Usage
+ View usage information:
  : $ cask exec package-toolset help
+ View package status:
  : $ cask exec package-toolset status
+ Install all the tools
  : $ cask exec package-toolset install
+ Print the melpa recipe for your repository
  : $ cask exec package-toolset melpa-recipe
+ Print the badges for the =README=
  : $ cask exec package-toolset badge
+ Setup unit test with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/][ert]] and [[https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el][ert-runner]]:
  : $ cask exec package-toolset setup-ert
+ Get the code to setup coverage with [[https://github.com/sviridov/undercover.el][undercover]]
  : $ cask exec package-toolset setup-undercover
+ Update travis config if needed with update-travis
  : $ cask exec package-toolset update-travis

*** Options
+ In case your =origin= remote is not targeting your github repository, you can specify
  it with the =-r <remote>= or =--remote <remote>= option
+ You could otherwise directly specify your repositoryname with the =-g= or =--github-repo=
  option. (don't forget your yoursername or put a stub one ;) =-g toto/secret.el=)
+ For the badges creation, you can specify the syntax you want with =-s <syntax>= or
  =--syntax <syntax>=. Legit values are =orgmode=, =markdown=, =rst= and =html=, =markown= being the default

** Features
# TODO: add status
# Â§IDEA: badge for CI level?
*** Skeleton File List

Here is the list of the scaffold file to set up continuous integration for your emacs package.

+ The =setup=, =install= command is to be run first, and will setup the following files
  - [[file:templates/Makefile][Makefile]] : The =Makefile=, and it's =test= targets
  - [[file:templates/.gitignore][.gitgnore]] : A classic =gitignore= designed for a /casked/ emacs package
  - [[file:templates/.travis.yml][.travis.yml]] : The build configuration file for Travis.
+ The =setup-ert= will setup unit test structure:
  - [[file:templates/test/test-helper.el][test-helper]] : Require testing libraries such as =ert=, =el-mock=, helper libraries (=dash= =s=)
    and setup useful variables to different path of the project.
    It also set up a convenience macro =with-sandbox= to perform operation in a test directory.
  - [[file:templates/testpackage-test.el][package-test]] : the file in which the test will have to be written :) (*cpt can't do that for you ;)*)
  - [[file:templates/.ert-runner][.ert-runner]] : configuration of the ert runner. (adding files to the loadpath)
+ The =setup-undercover= will help you set up coverage.

  It will output the code that need to be added to =test/test-helper.el= and =features/support/env.el= so that
  coverage metrics are computed while testing.

# TODO: add ecukes (maybe: call to ecukes new?)
*** Badges
/Cask Package Toolset/ will help you build badges to add to your README, so you can have an idea about
the current state of the package in just a glance.
Calling the =badge= command will output you a list of badges link you can then copy paste to your README.

So far support information such as build status, coverage, melpa status, licence, and also gitter.

/Cask Package Toolset/ supports three different syntaxes: orgmode, markdown and html.
By default you'll get markdown, but you can explicitely specify one of the syntax with the =-s/--syntax= option.

*** Melpa Recipe
If you have not yet published your package to melpa, /Cask Package Toolset/ can easily build up the basic recipe
for you'll just have to add to the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]].
Note that you might need to add something more than the name and repo (such as extra files to be included)

** Notes

This is no more a prototype, but some features are still added, driven by examples by the *toolsettization* of my own packages.

I will see with the =Cask= team to incorporate it so that that it can be accessed without adding it has Cask dependancy.

*If you have any remark, refactor suggestion or else, just pose an issue ;)*
